# BlackJack Project

# Description

This project was assigned during Week 4 of the Skill Distillery's Full Software Development with Java Cohort SD36 as an individual weekend project.

This is simple command-line application designed to simulate a BlackJack game. The purpose of creating this application to further my understanding in Object Oriented Programming. This was designed to help my insight into inheritance of subclasses as well working with abstract classes. It was also good practice for data encapsulation uses private and protected fields so data could not be accessed without using methods. It showed how complex things could get, such as using nested method calls to get the data you need.
# Technologies Used
GitHub, Java 1.8, Eclipse
#Lesson Learn
This is the first time I am working multiple layers of Superclass and Subclasses. With the layered, it takes a little more effort to keep track of which class is doing what. It would be very easy to write methods that do the identical things but that would be a waste of time and not the point of this project. Thing back to it, I should probably spend just a little more time with creating methods. One challenge I had was having to cast the Dealer class to my Player object to call it methods. I also did a lot nested calls to methods. My goal was to keep my could as DRY as possible and easy to read. Admitted it could still use quite a bit of refactoring to make it better but I'm happy with what I created and the challenges it was designed for me to overcome. For the next project, I'll have to really look at the UML and spec. requirements. I spent some time planning things my own way and it didn't quite match up the UML's direction. Which if we're simulating a client request, would be unsatisfactory.  Now this did cause a bit of frustration but, lesson learned, I need to look at the request/assignment fully before planning anything.
